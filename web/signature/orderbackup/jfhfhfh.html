If the store fails to sell $15,000, at wholesale, from the case and/or in special orders, Lashbrook will buy back product in an amount equal to the shortfall.
<br>2. Total Investment:   $14,997
<br>3. 30/60/90 (Three payments of $4999)
<br>4. No substitutions to the Tier 4.
<br>5. No stock balancing, unless initiated by Lashbrook, during the first year.</p>
<p><b>The following requirements must be met in order to qualify for buyback:</b>
<br>1. Payment terms must be met within a 10 day grace period.
<br>2. Store personnel must do Lashbrook training within 30 days of receipt of merchandise.
<br>3. Store must provide the information necessary for proper Knot promotion within ten business days of each request.
