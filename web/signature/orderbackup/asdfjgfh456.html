<h2>Guaranteed Sale Program</h2>
<p><b>Offer:</b>
<p>1. If a store purchases a Tier 4 and The Knot, Lashbrook will guarantee at least a one-time turn of the investment during the first year that they have the product in the case.  If the store fails to sell $15,000, at wholesale, from the case and/or in special orders, Lashbrook will buy back product in an amount equal to the shortfall.
<br>2. Total Investment:   $14,997
<br>3. 30/60/90 (Three payments of $4999)
<br>4. No substitutions to the Tier 4.
<br>5. No stock balancing, unless initiated by Lashbrook, during the first year.</p>
<p><b>The following requirements must be met in order to qualify for buyback:</b>
<br>1. Payment terms must be met within a 10 day grace period.
<br>2. Store personnel must do Lashbrook training within 30 days of receipt of merchandise.
<br>3. Store must provide the information necessary for proper Knot promotion within ten business days of each request.
<br>4. Product must be properly displayed.
<br>5. Store will have 60 days from end of 12 month period to notify us that they want a buyback.</p>
<p><b>Lashbrook buyback commitment:</b>
<br>1. If conditions are met, Lashbrook will buy back the Lashbrook product that the jeweler chooses, also with 30/60/90 terms.  For example, if a jeweler sells only $9,000 at wholesale during the first year, he may choose $6000 of product to sell back and Lashbrook will pay $2000/month for three months.</p>
